# End-to-End-Data-Analysis-and-Data-Warehousing-using-SQL
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis pipeline built entirely in SQL, demonstrating the creation of a 3-layer data warehouse (Bronze–Silver–Gold), ETL workflows, and advanced analytical querying for business insights.

## Project Overview
The project integrates six raw datasets containing customer, product, and sales information into a unified data warehouse. It covers all key stages of the data lifecycle, from extraction and transformation to analysis and reporting, to simulate a real-world business intelligence workflow.

## Data Warehouse Design
Bronze Layer: Stored raw data extracted from multiple sources with missing and inconsistent values.
Silver Layer: Applied transformation logic to cleanse, standardise, and harmonise data for analytical readiness.
Gold Layer: Built optimised fact and dimension views (Customer, Product, Sales) for efficient querying and reporting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA using SQL to identify key business patterns and anomalies, such as:
Customer distribution by country, age, and gender
Revenue trends and category performance
Key business metrics like total sales, orders, and high-performing products

## Advanced SQL Analytics
Applied advanced SQL techniques such as:
CTEs (Common Table Expressions),
Window Functions for ranking and time-based analysis,
Subqueries for dynamic segmentation and benchmarking
These were used to evaluate year-over-year performance, benchmark product categories, and segment customers by loyalty (VIP, regular, new), leading to detailed customer and product performance reports.

## Skills and Tools
SQL (for ETL, transformation, and analytics),
Data Warehousing Concepts (Bronze–Silver–Gold architecture),
Data Cleaning and Normalisation,
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
Advanced SQL Techniques: CTEs, window functions, subqueries

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used not just for querying data but for building an entire data analysis workflow, enabling data-driven business decisions.
